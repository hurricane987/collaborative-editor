			<p class="body-p">Throughout human history, there has never been a game such as this. I want you to close your eyes and imagine yourself as a bird. You are very good at flying, you are positively incapable of landing, and you are beset on all sides by the iniquities of green pipes and the tyranny of evil gravity. Just out of your reach is a goal, one which you cannot see, but which is nevertheless of paramount importance. So important, in fact, that you cannot and will not stop your progress toward it, though its true identity remains a mystery to you.</p>

			<p class="body-p"> Now I want you to imagine that with every flap of your little digital wings, the realization becomes clearer: your agonizing search has come to define you. The goal is unattainable, the struggle is infinite, and without it you are nothing.</p>
